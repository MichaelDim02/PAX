So you want to hack an account on a website that has a limit to the minimum number of characters of a password, but your 
dictionary is filled with small words that cannot be a password on that site? Do you want to know how to rid your wordlist
of small words? Try the ruby command below:



ruby -ne 'puts $_ if $_.chomp.length() >= 10 ' < wordlist.txt



Replace the 10 with the minimum number of characters, and the wordlist.txt with the name of your dictionary and you are good to go!
